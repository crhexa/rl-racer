# RL-Racer

A custom environment made using the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and written in C# used to train reinforcement learning models to drive a car on a top-down virtual track with semi-realistic physics. Utilizes the [Godot RL Agents](https://github.com/edbeeching/godot_rl_agents) framework to train agents using the Stable-Baselines3 implementation of OpenAI's [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://openai.com/research/openai-baselines-ppo) algorithm.
